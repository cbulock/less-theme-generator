# LESS Theme Generator

The general idea behind this is to create a directory that is laid out with files titled THEMENAME.less and then subdirectories named THEMENAME.

This script will go through that directory and generate CSS using LESS for each of those THEMENAME.less files and place them in the subdirectories.

This is helpful as those .less files can be specific to a theme, and then include other .less files that encompass the broder LESS that will be used for all themes.
